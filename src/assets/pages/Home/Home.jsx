            In the bustling heart of New York City, Peter Parker's life was
            flipped upside down by a single bite. He thought he was just a kid
            from Queens, but that moment unlocked a connection to a secret,
            extraordinary lineage â€“ not of ancient scrolls, but of unimaginable
            power and the crushing weight of responsibility. Now, he swings
            through skyscrapers, not as a chosen one of old, but as the
            protector our world desperately needs.
